OVERVIEW
========

The ChargeDemo source code demonstrates how to implement 2-way
integration for accepting credit card payments using Credit Card
Terminal for iPhone.

ChargeDemo supplies a single charge button. When it's tapped, a URL
request is made to Credit Card Terminal in order to accept a credit
card payment. When the user is done with Credit Card Terminal,
ChargeDemo will be launched via its URL handler for
`com-innerfence-ChargeDemo://`.

Protocol details are provided below in the case that you cannot or do
not wish to use our Objective-C classes.

Please visit our [Developer API
page](http://www.innerfence.com/apps/credit-card-terminal/app-developers)
to see how the user experience flow will be like.

INTEGRATION CHECKLIST
=====================

* Add the IFChargeRequest.h, IFChargeRequest.m, IFChargeResponse.h,
  and IFChargeResponse.m files to your Xcode project.

* Make sure your application is registered to handle a URL scheme
  inyour Info.plist. For example:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
  <dict>
    <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
    <string>com.innerfence.ChargeDemo</string>
    <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
    <array>
      <string>com-innerfence-ChargeDemo</string>
    </array>
  </dict>
</array>
```

* Request payment by creating an IFChargeRequest object, setting its
  properties, and calling its submit method. Be sure to set the
  returnURL property. Consider using setReturnURL:withExtraParams: to
  automatically include extra parameters in the query string. For
  example:

```objc
IFChargeRequest* chargeRequest =
    [[[IFChargeRequest alloc] init] autorelease];

// Include my record_id so it comes back with the response
[chargeRequest
    setReturnURL:@"com-innerfence-ChargeDemo://chargeResponse"
    withExtraParams:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:
        @"123", @"record_id",
        nil
    ]
];

chargeRequest.amount        = @"50.00";
chargeRequest.description   = @"Test transaction";
chargeRequest.invoiceNumber = @"321";

[chargeRequest submit];
```

* Handle charge responses in your app delegateâ€™s
  application:handleOpenURL: by creating an IFChargeResponse object
  using initWithURL:. Use the responseCode property to determine if
  the transaction was successful. For example:

```objc
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication*)application handleOpenURL:(NSURL*)url
{
    IFChargeResponse* chargeResponse =
        [[[IFChargeResponse alloc] initWithURL:url] autorelease];

    // My record_id from the request is available in the extraParams
    // dictionary.
    NSString* recordId = [chargeResponse.extraParams objectForKey:@"record_id"];

    // Since this value is from the URL, I need to validate it.
    if ( !IsValidRecordId( recordId ) )
    {
        // handle error
    }

    if ( chargeResponse.responseCode == kIFChargeResponseCodeApproved )
    {
        // Transaction succeeded, check out these properties:
        //  * chargeResponse.amount
        //  * chargeResponse.cardType
        //  * chargeResponse.redactedCardNumber
    }
    else
    {
        // Transaction failed.
    }
}
```

PROTOCOL REQUEST
================

The Charge request is simply a set of query string parameters which
are appended to a Base URL. Be sure to properly encode the query
string parameters.

Base URL: `com-innerfence-ccterminal://charge/1.0.0/`

* `returnAppName` - your app's name, displayed to give the user context
* `returnURL` - your app's URL handler, see PROTOCOL RESPONSE
* `fm` - if set to 1, the FileMaker-compatible response format will be used
* `amount` - amount of the transaction (e.g. `10.99`, `1.00`, `0.90`)
* `currency` - currecy code of amount (e.g. `USD`)
* `email` - customer's email address for receipt
* `firstName` - billing first name
* `lastName` - billing lastName
* `company` - billing company name
* `address` - billing street address
* `city` - billing city
* `state` - billing state or province (e.g. `TX`, `ON`)
* `zip` - billing zip or postal code
* `phone` - billing phone number
* `country` - billing country code (e.g. `US`)
* `invoiceNumber` - merchant-assigned invoice number
* `description` - description of goods or services

Here is a simple example. Please note the correct encoding of parameters:

```
com-innerfence-ccterminal://charge/1.0.0/?amount=10.99&email=john%40example.com&returnURL=com-your-app%3A%2F%2Faction%2F
```

PROTOCOL RESPONSE
=================

When the request includes a `returnURL`, the results of the charge
will be returned via the URL by including additional query string
parameters. These parameters all begin with ifcc_ to avoid conflict
with any query parameters your app may already recognize.

* `ifcc_responseType` - `approved`, `cancelled`, `declined`, or `error`
* `ifcc_transactionId` - transaction id (e.g. `100001`)
* `ifcc_amount` - amount charged (e.g. `10.99`)
* `ifcc_currency` - currency of amount (e.g. `USD`)
* `ifcc_redactedCardNumber` - redacted card number (e.g. `XXXXXXXXXXXX1111`)
* `ifcc_cardType` - card type: `Visa`, `MasterCard`, `Amex`, `Discover`, `Maestro`, `Solo`, or `Unknown`

Here is a simple example:

```
com-your-app://action/?ifcc_responseType=approved&ifcc_transactionId=100001&ifcc_amount=10.99&ifcc_currency=USD&ifcc_redactedCardNumber=XXXXXXXXXXXX1111&ifcc_cardType=Visa
```

When the `fm=1` parameter is included in the original request, the
response is modified by including a dollar-sign ($) before each query
value so that they can be accessed by FileMaker Go scripts. For instance,
instead of `ifcc_responseType=success`, `$ifcc_responseType=success`.
